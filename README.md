**Architecting With Small Teams**

    On a smaller team, each individual wears more of the hats. If there is no team then it's up to you to play all of the roles. This talk invites a discussion around architecting the process and not just the software. Roman will facilitate the discussion.

    Feel free to arrive up to 15 minutes early for pizza and impressions.

    At 7:00 pm Roman will start a presentation focused on his experience and invite you and your peers to share yours.

**Goals, Deadlines, Progress and User Interface Tools**

    Gabriel will share how to understand and work with the business and management side of development projects, and the associated tools and thinking for decision making. This is a bunch of stuff that isn't engineering, but effects it greatly. Like setting great goals, effective deadlines, tracking progress, etc.

    Bradley will present a buyer's guide style overview on User Interface frameworks and libraries, focusing on CSS. The main libraries in discussion are Bootstrap and Material and why these frameworks are so prominent. Bradley will further dive into modern CSS practices like using Flexbox to style websites for desktop and mobile platforms. Come for discussion of best practices and hands-on demos!

**Three Paradigms**

    Jeff will facilitate an interactive discussion about the evolution of programming languages. We will explore the difference between imperative and declarative styles. Knowing a bit of programming history helps us understand the problems different languages are trying to solve.
